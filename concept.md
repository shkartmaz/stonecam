# The Lightbox
*Plywood box with bells and whistles for pics and measurement*
This is a concept

## Basic structure
- A box without a front wall
- Two compartaments: big lower working space; small upper tech attic
- dimensions 70x70x70 working area, h20 attic, h10 basement, 50-70 legs

## Lights
Bright neutral while LED strips mounted on the roof

## Inner walls
- white glossy or semi-glossy *something*
- perhaps acrylic spray paint will do

## Outer shell
- protective coating
- metal corners
- some cool markings (stencil or laser)
- wheels and handle
- detatchable lid

## Optics
- one main camera on a movable post
- **two cameras - top and side - for size estimation**
**OR**
- three (jeez!) ultrasound sensors / lasers (unlikely option)

## Weight measurement
- Some sort of USB scale or something

## Brain
- Raspberry Pi
**OR**
- Arduino UNO - analog capabilities
**OR**
- A miniPC/netbook/shitty laptop of some sort
**OR**
- Some unholy combo of the above

UNO doesn't seem powerful enough, and analog shit is to be avoided anyway
Pi might fit, but I might need 4 USB devices, at least one of them being an HD camera. Also, a way of interacting with the thing is required - extra cost
An old laptop might be my best bet: has keyboard and screen, multiple USBs
Babushka's Atom LMAO - what an arc!
Samsung Tablet PC - nahhhh
